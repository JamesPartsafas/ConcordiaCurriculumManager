"022617","This course is a multidisciplinary introduction to the field of Irish studies, a discipline that embraces a broad range of historical and contemporary issues as they have manifested themselves on the island of Ireland, in Canada and throughout the world. In particular, questions related to individual and national identities in the context of history, language, culture, landscape, and religion are explored and debated."
"022618","Drawing on a diversity of historiographical materials, this interdisciplinary course examines the story of the Irish in Canada with a particular emphasis on Quebec, from the French colonial period through the City of Montreal's golden era of mercantile prominence in the mid-19th century to the break-up of its older Irish neighbourhoods a century afterwards. Starting with the demographics of Irish immigration and settlement, it devotes special attention to social and cultural relations between the Irish and other ethnic groups.NOTE: Students who have received credit for HIST 213 or for this topic under a HIST 398 number may not take this course for credit."
"022619","From 17th-century fishermen and traders arriving in Newfoundland to displaced victims of the Famine in the 19th century, to contemporary immigrants from Ireland, the Irish have had a presence in all parts of Canada from the earliest days of settlement. This course examines the emigration and settlement patterns of Irish immigrants in the various regions of Canada across a period of three centuries, paying particular attention to their role in the social, economic, political, cultural, and educational development of Canadian society. The course explores the various strategies by which Irish immigrants both adapted to and transformed the particular host society in which they found themselves, and looks at other immigrant communities as a means of understanding the special contribution of the Irish to Canada.NOTE: Students who have received credit for HIST 212 or for this topic under a HIST 398 number may not take this course for credit."
"022620","After establishing some broader historical context, this survey course traces modern Irish history in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Special attention is given to the development of Irish nationalism and relations with Great Britain.NOTE: Students who have received credit for HIST 211 or for this topic under an IRST 298 number may not take this course for credit."
"022621","This course provides a general introduction to Irish linguistic and cultural practices in modern and contemporary Ireland. It explores the principles of the Irish language and introduces students to the language through folklore, song, poetry, film, drama, and storytelling.NOTE: Students who have received credit for MIRI 290 may not take this course for credit."
"022622","Please see UGRD Calendar"
"022623","This course is designed to allow students to conduct focused study of a given subject (e.g. literature, history, language, music, film) in an Irish context. The experience in Ireland may be in the context of a structured school environment or may take the form of a more independent exploration. Based upon preparatory readings and assignments done at Concordia, students enrich their learning experience in Ireland, followed by assignments completed upon their return to Concordia. All course content and requirements are established in consultation with the School.Prerequisite: Permission of the School. Prerequisites are determined on an individual basis by the School. NOTE: Students may take this course two times for credit provided the subject matter is different."
"022631","Irish Studies span a spectrum of disciplines from the humanities, fine arts and the social and political sciences. Conducting research within this diverse domain requires a broad-based set of applied and theoretical skills. This interdisciplinary course prepares upper-level undergraduates for research in Irish studies, for academic and field situations in Ireland, and in Irish diasporic settings overseas. While cross-disciplinary methodologies are emphasized throughout the course, particular attention is given to research planning and logistics, archival investigation, cross-cultural interviewing, “participant observation” fieldwork training, applied theoretical modelling, and thesis management."
"022632","Please see Undergraduate Calendar"
"022633","This course examines the social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions of the Great Irish Famine. Beginning with a thorough examination of society and politics in the pre-Famine period, the course explores the causes and course of the 1845-50 Famine, with emphasis on social conditions, mass mortality, emigration, and British government responses to conditions in Ireland. The outcomes and long-term consequences of the Famine for Irish society, politics, Anglo-Irish relations, and the Irish Diaspora are also explored. Some attention is also given to historiographical debates and Famine memory.NOTE: Students who have received credit for HIST 330 or for this topic under a HIST or IRST 398 number may not take this course for credit."

"037304","Peer instruction is a research-based pedagogy that actively engages students in the classroom and has been shown to dramatically improve conceptual understanding, even in large classes. The basic goals of peer instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.~~~By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes2. Explain how Peer Instruction can be used to address identified challenges with student engagement 3.

Do you want to move your writing from functional closer to the level and style of a native speaker?English Grammar 1 is the first in a set of two grammar workshops targeted toward non-native English-speaking graduate students at Concordia University. This workshop gives participants a solid foundation needed to move toward producing polished papers, reports, and theses at an advanced level. English Grammar 1 helps remedy some of the most persistent grammar problems that advanced learners of English face – namely, those related to subject-verb agreement, articles, choosing the right verb tense and the use of passive voice – and it supports students who want to become better writers.~~~ By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:1.	Identify and solve some of the most common grammar problems non-native English-speaking graduate students face such as subject-verb agreement, articles, verb tense and passive voice.2.	Recognize and correct these grammar problems when they appear in texts.3.	Apply grammar-related specificities of English academic writing style in own writing.~~~This workshop is led by Javier Ibarra-Isassi. Javier is a PhD candidate in Biology and his research is focused on answering the questions where organisms are in the world and why they are there. He has a soft spot for ants, so he chose these little creatures as the model system of his research. Before coming to Montreal, he completed his BSc in El Salvador and his MSc in Brazil.

"049462","Although academic journals and other scholarly outlets are valuable, their impact outside of academia is questionable as scholarly publications often sit in digital repositories where they are rarely read by non-academics.Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ‘lede’ and ‘hook’ (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field. ~~~After attending this workshop, participants will be able to:1.

"049902","***This workshop is intended for current or future students in research-based graduate programs, who are preparing a Fall scholarship application to a federal or provincial government research agency.***Writing strategies and tips can often be applied globally, so this workshop aims to offer ways that graduate students can develop and improve their scholarship applications. For example, this workshop will offer writing tips to aid in the development of many standard and essential sections of the application (e.g. outline of proposed research, and other applicant statements). Funding agencies typically expect students to be the author of their own applications, but this does not mean writing in isolation – and does not exclude the important contributions and feedback of peers, research supervisors and other mentors.  Note: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they select.~~~After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: •	Identify peers to provide essential feedback on sections of the application, as well as the application as a whole.•	Consider ways to benchmark against materials from previous scholarship winners.•	Adapt their writing and presentation styles to present achievements in succinct and effective ways.~~~This workshop is led by Michael Verwey, the Fellowship Development Advisor in the School of Graduate Studies at Concordia University.

"050354","We all want to make the most of our lives. We want to learn time management skills to work more effectively and efficiently. We want to be able to make time for what truly matters to us. But how?As a leader in time management research, Brad Aeon has developed a 4-part workshop that will help you manage your time more meaningfully.Based on over a decade of scientific research, his workshops have helped hundreds of people worldwide increase their personal productivity, health, happiness, and well-being. The four parts are:1. Purpose. The first step in improving your time management skills is to determine what you really want out of life. You can't effectively manage time if you don't know how you want to spend it. After all, we all manage time for something. This session will help you figure out what that something is. Drawing on the latest research on purpose, meaning in life, motivation, and goal setting, this session will help you find a sense of purpose that inspires and energizes you.2. Structure. Schedules, calendars, and to-do lists are all tools you can use to gain control of your time. But few people use these tools properly. We think we know how to use them, but in reality they are often more of a hindrance than a help. This session will teach you how to use time management tools effectively, so you can turn them into powerful allies rather than stubborn enemies.3. Information. Social media, emails, texts, and other digital tools are the most obvious time wasters in our lives. They all compete for your attention. And whatever captures your attention also captures your time. If you want to have more time in the 21st century, you have to learn how to manage the information you receive. This session will teach you techniques to filter, organize, and sort information effectively, so that it works for you rather than against you.4. Priorities. Most of us have more things that we want to do than time in which to do them. The only way out of this situation is to learn how to prioritize. This session will teach you how to take a step back, assess your life, and determine your most important goals, so you can focus your precious time on the things that really matter.~~~This workshop will help students improve their time management skills.~~~This workshop is led by Brad Aeon. Brad Aeon is obsessed with how people think about and use time. He did his PhD on the history, sociology, and psychology of time management. His TED Talk The Philosophy of Time Management invites people to reconsider their relationship with time from a fundamental and existential perspective. Brad’s research and ideas have been featured in top media outlets, including the Harvard Business Review, BBC News, and CBC. He has worked with numerous companies and nonprofits to help people feel more in control of their time using evidence-based, innovative strategies.

While oxygen, food, water, and love sustain him, it is the act of creating that makes him feel most fully human. And that creativity most often finds expression in the act of visual storytelling. In addition to his drone skills, Diego designs and produces motion images for cinema and for multimedia. His films have screened at prominent festivals in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. One of his most recent films, Ex-voto for Three Souls, won a Golden Frog Award at the Plus Camerimage Festival (2008), the world’s premiere film festival dedicated to the art of cinematography. A drone pilot licensed by Transport Canada, Diego is thrilled to be leading this workshop to help train the next generation of drone videographers.<b>Diego Rivera Kohn</b><br>Titulaire d’une maîtrise ès beaux-arts en production cinématographique de l’Université Concordia, Diego Rivera Kohn est coordonnateur du programme d’animation de synthèse.

Outre ses compétences dans le maniement des drones, Diego Rivera Kohn conçoit et produit des images en mouvement pour le cinéma et le multimédia.
